I'm the CR of my class(Batch 2017-2021). The story of this script is kind of funny. In the 7th semester, My Visual Programming teacher asks me to make group of all the students and give numbers to each group for the coming presentation. I ask all the class and no one is ready to take group A(as it will be the first to present thier idea) so I wrote this script to gave group numbers randomly.<p style="font-size:100px">&#128540;</p>
